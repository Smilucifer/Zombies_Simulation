This is a simulation of a zombie burst.

Ver 0.0.1 Alpha

Dividing creature into human, the infected, zombies.

Human and the infected would have a little bit faster speed than zombies so they are able to escape.
(Plan to add transportation in later version like motor or car)

human would have a life as 5. every time zombies attack human, human reduce 1 point of life, and get infected.
If life goes 0, human dies instead of getting infected.

Setting special places, the Umbrella Inc. and safe house. If human roam to the Umb Inc. he/she would be infected.

All infected would become zombies after 30 sec(in PC time).

In this version, zombies would be immortal creature, human cannot kill them or rescue the infected.

Zombies would avoid approaching the safe house because they hate the smell of onions.
